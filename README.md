Project 1: Stock Market Indicator (MACD)

This project analyzes the effectiveness of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator for investment decisions using historical Netflix stock data. It examines the impact of using MACD for trading decisions with different constraints and investigates whether MACD is a lagging indicator.

Project 2: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

This project implements and compares different numerical methods for solving systems of linear equations, including:

    Iterative Methods: Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel
    Direct Method: LU Factorization

The study analyzes the convergence of these methods, their computational efficiency, and cases where iterative methods fail to converge, requiring the use of LU factorization.

Project 3: Elevation Profile Approximation

This project focuses on approximating elevation profiles using numerical interpolation techniques:

    Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation
    Cubic Spline Interpolation

The study compares these methods using different elevation profiles, such as the Sahara Desert, the Challenger Deep, and a flat urban area. It highlights the limitations of Lagrange interpolation due to the Runge phenomenon and demonstrates the advantages of using cubic splines for smoother and more accurate approximations.
